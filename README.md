## About Me

I'm a frontend developer with a strong focus on building clean, responsive, and user-centric web applications. My goal is to deliver interfaces that not only look great but also perform efficiently across devices.

I build with modern technologies like React, Nextjs, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, applying best practices in both design and development to create seamless user experiences.
